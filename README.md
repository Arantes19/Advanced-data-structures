# Advanced-data-structures

## Overview:

The scope of this project lies in the development of a software solution in the area of micromobility. The growing ecosystem of new forms of social mobility, particularly those occurring over short distances, has promoted the necessary integration of multiple means of transportation. This transformation in how mobility is carried out, an essential factor for the development of spaces, cities, and others, will depend on actions that allow for streamlining the use of means of transport that support easier, faster, cleaner, and more economical mobility, such as electric mobility means (scooters, bicycles, etc.)
