# EDA_2.1.2

Overview:

The function responsible for listing vehicles in descending order is poorly implemented, I couldn't fix it.
I couldn't do point 4 of phase 2, I tried to implement it but I couldn't.
Overall, everything was done and I put into practice the concepts given in Advanced Data Structures.
