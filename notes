each node of the graph:
 - geocode of the node
 - vehicle associate can be null
 - client associate can be null
 - edge associate can be null

each edge of the graph:
 - geocode of the node connected
 - weight associate

each vehicle of the graph:
 - vehicle code associated
 - vehicle geocode 
 - vehicle type
 - vehicle batery
 - vehicle weight

each client of the graph:
 - client code associated
 - client geocode

Fase 2: 
Ex3 Algorithm

1. Read the location of the client from the input or retrieve it from the desired source.
2. Specify the type of electric mobility means you want to search for.
3. Specify the radius within which you want to search for electric mobility means.
4. Load the graph data structure from the text file, which contains the locations of the clients and electric mobility means.
5. Traverse the graph to find the client's location based on the given information.
6. Once the client's location is found, traverse the adjacent nodes of the client's node within the specified radius:
Initialize a variable (e.g., totalWeight) to keep track of the cumulative weight of the edges.
Traverse the adjacent nodes of the client's node.
For each adjacent node, calculate the distance between the nodes and check if it is within the radius:
Retrieve the weight of the edge connecting the client's node and the current adjacent node.
Add the weight to the totalWeight.
If the distance is within the radius, proceed to the next step.
7. Count the number of electric mobility means within the radius that match the desired vehicle type:
Initialize a variable (e.g., count) to keep track of the number of matching electric mobility means.
Traverse the adjacent nodes of the client's node again.
For each adjacent node, check if it represents an electric mobility mean and if its type matches the desired vehicle type:
Retrieve the relevant information (e.g., nodeType, nodeVehicleType) to determine if it represents an electric mobility mean and its type.
If it represents an electric mobility mean and the type matches the desired vehicle type, increment the count.
8. Display or process the count to see how many electric mobility means of the desired type are within the specified radius.
